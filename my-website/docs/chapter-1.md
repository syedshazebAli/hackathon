# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI combines artificial intelligence with physical systems.  
Unlike software-only AI—which runs on servers, analyzes data, or powers apps—**Physical AI lives in the real world**. It **senses**, **thinks**, and **acts** using hardware like cameras, microphones, motors, and arms.

## How Is Physical AI Different?

| Software-Only AI          | Physical AI                     |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Runs on computers/cloud  | Runs on robots or smart devices |
| Processes digital data   | Interacts with the physical world |
| Output: predictions, text, recommendations | Output: movement, speech, physical actions |

Physical AI uses:
- **Sensors** (to perceive the environment — like eyes and ears)
- **AI algorithms** (to understand and decide — the “brain”)
- **Actuators** (to take action — like muscles or wheels)

## Real-World Examples

- **Humanoid robots**: Walk, grasp objects, and interact with people (e.g., Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics Atlas)  
- **Autonomous drones**: Navigate skies, deliver packages, or inspect infrastructure  
- **Smart machines**: Factory robots that adapt to new tasks, or home assistants that move and respond to voice

These systems don’t just *compute*—they *exist* and *operate* in our world, making AI truly embodied.

> 💡 **Key Idea**: Physical AI = Intelligence + Body

In the next chapter, we’ll explore **why humanoid robots** are a powerful platform for Physical AI—and how they help us build more helpful, adaptable machines.
