Humanoid robots are machines designed to resemble the human form and mimic human behaviors—from walking and grasping to seeing and listening.  
Unlike wheeled or industrial robots, humanoids are built to **operate in spaces made for people**, such as homes, offices, and public streets.

## Why Build Robots That Look Like Humans?

Humans have shaped the world around their own bodies:
- Doors have handles at arm’s height  
- Stairs match human stride  
- Tools fit human hands  

A humanoid robot can **naturally interact** with this environment—without requiring special infrastructure.

## Key Components of a Humanoid Robot

| Part    | Function | Common Technologies |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **Head** | Perception & interaction | Cameras (eyes), microphones (ears), speakers (voice), LED displays (expressions) |
| **Arms** | Manipulation & gestures | Joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist), grippers or hands, force/torque sensors |
| **Legs** | Locomotion & mobility | Hip/knee/ankle joints, motors, balance control systems |
| **Torso** | Core support & integration | Houses battery, computer, and communication systems; critical for balance |

Together, these parts enable complex behaviors like:
- Walking on uneven terrain  
- Picking up a cup without crushing it  
- Turning the head to look at someone speaking  
- Waving hello or shaking hands

## Human-Centric Design

Humanoid robots aren’t just about looks—they’re about **functionality in human spaces**.  
Because they share our form, they can:
- Use everyday tools (e.g., open a door, press an elevator button)  
- Communicate through familiar body language  
- Work safely alongside people in shared environments

> 💡 **Fun Fact**: Even if a robot doesn’t *need* two legs, having them allows it to go anywhere a human can—no ramps or modifications required!

In the next chapter, we’ll explore how **sensors and actuators** bring these human-like machines to life.
