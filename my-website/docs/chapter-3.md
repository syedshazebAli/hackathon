A humanoid robot isn’t just metal and motors—it has a **brain**.  
This “brain” isn’t a single program, but a **team of AI systems** working together to see, understand, speak, and act. Think of it like different parts of the human mind: one for language, one for vision, one for planning.

Let’s break down the three core types of intelligence that power modern humanoid robots.

## 🗣️ Language Intelligence

Humanoid robots use **Large Language Models (LLMs)**—like the AI behind chatbots—to:
- Understand spoken or typed questions (“What’s the weather today?”)
- Generate natural-sounding responses (“It’s sunny and 25°C!”)
- Follow instructions (“Please bring me a bottle from the kitchen”)

This lets them **communicate like humans**, making interactions smooth and intuitive.

> 💡 *Note*: The robot doesn’t “know” things—it predicts likely responses based on vast training data.

## 👀 Vision Intelligence

Using **computer vision**, robots can:
- Recognize people, objects, and obstacles
- Track moving targets (like a waving hand)
- Map their surroundings for navigation

Cameras act as the robot’s eyes, while deep learning models turn pixels into understanding—“That’s a chair,” “This is a staircase,” “A person is standing in front.”

This vision system is essential for **safe movement** and **meaningful interaction**.

## 🧠 Decision Making

Once a robot understands language and sees the world, it must **decide what to do next**.

This is where **reinforcement learning** and planning algorithms come in:
- The robot tries actions (e.g., “reach for the cup”)
- It receives feedback (success = reward, drop = penalty)
- Over time, it learns the best strategies

In real time, it might combine pre-programmed safety rules with learned behaviors to choose actions that are **smart, safe, and goal-oriented**.

## Putting It All Together

Imagine a robot asked:  
> “Can you hand me the red box on the table?”

1. **Language AI** understands the request.  
2. **Vision AI** locates the red box on the table.  
3. **Decision AI** plans a path, avoids obstacles, and controls arm movement.  

All three systems run in parallel—just like your brain!

> 💡 **Key Idea**: The AI brain = Language + Vision + Decision-making → Action

In the next chapter, we’ll explore the **sensors and actuators** that turn these AI decisions into real-world movement.
